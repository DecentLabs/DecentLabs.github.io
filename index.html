						<h1>Why?</h1>
						<p>Decentralization enables social collaboration on a scale unprecedented in human history. We believe that it will transform the world into a more inclusive and safer place. We feel just as excited about taking an active part in this, as we were back in the early days of the Internet.</p>

						<p>Centralized systems may seem more efficient than the organic chaos of decentralization. However, centralization causes rare but spectacular failures, wiping out any short term benefits. Such fragility is evidenced by occasional financial collapses, infrastructure meltdowns. Centralization is also characterized by systematic corruption, oppression of minority needs and a general lack of innovation.</p>

						<p>We want to fix that! If you feel the same way, come say Hi on our <a href="https://decent-slack-autoinvite.herokuapp.com/">Slack channel</a> or email us: <a href="mailto:hello@decent.org">hello@decent.org</a></p>
